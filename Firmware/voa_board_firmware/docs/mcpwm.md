### Timers

According to the resources each MCPWM group has three independent timer, but these timer aren't in syncron.

### Operators & Comparators & Generators

Each MCPWM group has three different operator, each stores two comparators and two generators.

## ZXB52* motor driver IC

- There is two input pin
    - Reverse (REV)
    - Forward (FWD)

## GOAL

Create a stepper motor driver with these components.

## Design

This stepper motor is a bipolar stepper motor, with two independent coil. These are required two different motor driver.
Forward and reverse mode can't be in one MCPWM group because:
- FWD and REV inputs need two generators, which are only available in one operator group.
- Two operator needed because of the two independent coils of the stepper motor. 
- Three operator are available in one MCPWM group and two are allocated for forward mode and the left one is not enough for reverse.

## Issue during development

With two MCPWM group (one for reverse and one for forwards) when rooted in the same output pins only one will work.

-> Solution: On direction change the generators need to be deinitialized and reinitialize.

\+ Information: Only one timer is enough because in this case no timer syncronisation is needed.
