## Folder structure

### Docs

### Simulation

This folder contains hardware simulations about:
- ESD protection circuit,
- monitor-diode amplifier circuit,
- reserve and overvoltage protection circuit,
- LASER-diode current controller circuit.

### Hardware

In this folder there are the hardware components, such as:
- a motor driver board to control Variable Optical Attenuator (VOA) module,
- a laser driver board, which cools the laser module and set the right current of it.

### Firmware

This folder stores the software components of the project, such as:
- test softwares for hardware debugging,
- softwares for ESP-32
